# Githubsearch - Angular App from Quickstart

You can get an API key by going to [Developer Applications](https://github.com/settings/developers).


## Clone Quickstart
```
git clone https://github.com/angular/quickstart project-name
```
where project-name is the name of the folder you want it in.

Afterwards, you have to set up dependencies.  Go into project-name directory and type:
```
npm install
```
BTW, the e2e folder is for testing.

Once the dependencies are installed, you can start the application by typing:
```
npm start
```
It has the profile component, so finally, the directory structure in src/app looks like this:
```
.
|-- app.component.js
|-- app.component.js.map
|-- app.component.spec.js
|-- app.component.spec.js.map
|-- app.component.spec.ts
|-- app.component.ts
|-- app.module.js
|-- app.module.js.map
|-- app.module.ts
`-- components
    |-- profile.component.html
    |-- profile.component.js
    |-- profile.component.js.map
    `-- profile.component.ts

```
